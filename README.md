# Snake
<br>
<br>
Hello, <a href="https://ivanmpr.github.io/Snake/">here</a> is a classic Snake game project in
my interpretation.

Fun and interesting project, I built my <a href="https://ivanmpr.github.io/Tetris/">Tetris</a> project
with settimeout and setinterval methods for the game flow, and I created Snake with requestAnimationFrame,
and that's where the main focus was for me on this game.
